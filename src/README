GRPN Version 1.1.2

By Paul Wilkins

GRPN is a RPN calculator for the X Window system built using
the GIMP Toolkit (GTK).

GRPN works with real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, and
complex matrices.  Numbers can be displayed in 4 different
radix modes, and complex numbers can be displayed in either
Cartesian or polar form.

GRPN is copyrighted under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  See the file LICENSE for more details.


To build GRPN:

1) Edit the Makefile to tell the compiler where to find the X
   and GTK headers and libraries if you do not have the 
   gtk-config script properly installed.  Most systems will not
   need this.

2) Run make.  

3) Copy the executable, grpn, to it's final installation directory,
   for example /usr/local/bin.



GRPN can be found (ftp) at the following locations:
ibiblio.org /pub/Linux/apps/math/calc
lashwhip.com /pub


That's it.  Good Luck.
